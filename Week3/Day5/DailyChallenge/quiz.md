## What is a class?

A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It's where we teach objects
to behave. It incorporates both state and behaviour.

## What is an instance?

It is a single occurence of a class. A specific example, an object.

## What is encapsulation?
Attributes and methods capable of processing data. A class is an example of encapsulation. You can also restrict access to variables and methods from outside of the class.

## What is abstraction?
Hiding complex implementation details and only exposing the necessary functionalities or interfaces to the user. A class is an example of abstraction. 

## What is inheritance?
Allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another or parent class. Allows us to reuse code instead of creating a class from scratch everytime to perform the same action.

## What is multiple inheritance?
Multiple inheritance enables a child class to inherit the methods and properties of multiple parent classes. 

## What is polymorphism?

Methods, functions, operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects. For example, in inheritance, when a child object overrides the method of the parent. So the method name is the same but the method definition may be different resulting in different behaviour. 


## What is method resolution order or MRO?
Method Resolution Order is relevant in multiple inheritance. The rule that Python follows to determine, when you run a method, which one to actually run.
